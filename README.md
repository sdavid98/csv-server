# HS onboarding task

## Part 1
- Create a function that reads the data from the csvs.
Serve the retrieved data from the csv on an API in json format.
- Each csv result shall have a separate API endpoint
- Pagination Example /<resource_name>?limit=10&offset=1

## Part 2
- Create a React application and design it with CSS to match the given wireframe.
- Make sure your design works on mobile and desktop too.
- Fetch the data with Javascript from the API endpoints created in the previous task.
- Fill each table with the fetched data using Javascript.
- Implement pagination
- Implement an input field, where you can change the length of the table items based on the input fields value.
(eg: If you write 5 in the input field the table should only show 5 items.)
- +1: Add loading state while the application waits for the fetch result.
